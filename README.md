# doctor-at-home-app
# Description
 Due to Covid-19, we found that the idea of examining or reserving a doctor online is not supported, although it will be very useful at the current time, so we decided to implement the idea of “Doctor at Home” application.
 
The Application has the following Features:-
 1. Enables the patient to fill his/her medical record, search for doctor, reserve an appointment and chat with the doctor for consultation. 
 2.	Enables the doctor to write a prescription and add the appointments. 
 3.	Enables recommendation system to recommend medicines using Decision Tree. 
 4.	Enables diagnosis system to diagnose if the uploaded image is Pneumonia or Tuberculosis and Chatbot using CNN.
